## Motivation

You're a teaching assistant at AUT and you think that you can change the university courses by integerating them with GitHub. Ofcourse you're wrong but you're young and have a lot of hope. So you start enrolling them in an orginization and all of a sudden you findout there is 150 student and enrolling them takes a long time. You decide to write a fun application and use GitHub API to automate this process.
